# SharpGPG
A GPG wrapper for C# capable of encryption/decryption/importing keys etc.

Uses GPGAPI https://gpgapi.codeplex.com/

Very simple tool to make it easier to get the basics done

You will require gnupg classic, not Gpg4Win if you intend on having a password. Otherwise it will ignore password input. This can be found under binaries on https://www.gnupg.org/download/
